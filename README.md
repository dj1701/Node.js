This repository contains a number of Code Katas to enable Engineers to get up and running quickly with Node.js, React.js and Angular.js.

Instruction on commands to use:
-------------------------------

1.  npm install

    Downloads all dependences needed for creating the node_module folder.

2.  npm test

    This will run all the tests implemented in the spec.js files covering both unit and integration tests (SuperTest implemented in the application-spec.js).

3.  npm start

    This will spin up the Node Application and listen on the specified port.  The projects have the default view engine set and will return index.html file on the root url.
