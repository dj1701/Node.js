# Node.js

This repository contains a number of Code Katas with a Skeleton Project (saves time on setup) to enable Engineers to get up and running quickly with Node.js and React.js.

Instruction on commands to use:
-------------------------------

1.  npm install

    Downloads all dependences needed for creating the node_module folder.
    
2.  npm test

    This will run all the tests implemented in the spec.js files covering both unit and integration test (SuperTest implemented in the application-spec.js).
    
3.  npm start

    This will spin up the Node Application and listen on the specified port.  Apart from the Skeletion Project the other projects have the default view engine set and will return index.html file on the root url.
    
    Open a browser and go to http://localhost:4000/private/health to test the app is running. Note: dependent upon which port is set.
