# Node.js

This repository contains a Skeleton Project (saves time on setup) to enable Engineers to get up and running quickly with Node.js and React.js.

Instruction on commands to use:
-------------------------------

1.  npm install

    Downloads all dependences needed for creating the node_module folder.
    
2.  npm test

    This will run all the tests implemented in the spec.js files covering both unit and integration test (SuperTest implemented in the application-spec.js).
    
3.  npm start

    This will spin up the Node Application and listen on the specified port.  There is no default view engine set.
    
    Open a browser and go to http://localhost:4000/private/health to test the app is running. Note: dependent upon which port is set.
